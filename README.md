# Automatic-summarization

> This project was undertaken to apply the concepts of Natural language processing and build a simple summariser that I can build on in my internship at Cisco. 

When we have unbelievably huge amount of data, it is impossible for a user to get insights. Furthermore, a large portion of this data is either redundant or doesn't contain much useful information. The most efficient way to get access to the most important parts of the data is to summarize the data in a way that it contains non-redundant and useful information only. The data can be in any form such as audio, video, images, and text. In this project, I have used an algorithm that is based on frequency of words

#Requirement
Install requirement.txt file using this command
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

# Data 
Add a sample file as input to the Model.

# Run

To run, use the following command:
```
python Summarizer.py <filename> -l <length of expected summary>
```
The length field is optional and defaults to 4
